# DoIKnowYou (Enhanced) for The Burning Crusade

This is an enhanced, bugfixed version of **DoIKnowYou** for The Burning Crusade! (TBC 2.4.6)

**Enhancements:**

- Now shows author names for shared notes. This makes it very easy to see who wrote each comment, which helps you decide whether you trust that opinion or not. Especially useful in large guilds where lots of people use this addon!

**Fixed Bugs:**

- You will no longer get disconnected whenever the addon attempts to sync lots of data.
- The addon is now capable of syncing long player notes/comments. (The official version always lost tons of data whenever it attempted to sync long notes.)

**Download: [DoIKnowYouEnhancedTBC-master.zip](https://github.com/VideoPlayerCode/DoIKnowYouEnhancedTBC/archive/master.zip)** (Put the inner "DoIKnowYou" folder into your WoW's "Interface/AddOns" folder.)
